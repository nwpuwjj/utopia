# Makefile.nmake - Builds static and dynamic versions of the libhdkcli library.
#
# Generated Binary Files
#   + Dynamic library
#      - libhdkcli.dll : The dynamic library, linked against shared (dynamic) libhdkxml (libhdkxml.dll) and
#                        multithreaded crt (msvcrXX.dll) libraries
#      - libhdkcli.lib : Defines import methods for libhdkcli.dll.
#   + Static library
#      - libhdkcliMT.lib : The static library, linked against static versions of libexpat (libhdkxmlMT.lib) and
#                          multithreaded static crt (libcmt.lib) libraries
#
# Build environment variables
#   - BUILDDIR : The directory in which the generated binary files are placed.
#                The default is $(HDKDIR)\build\libhdkcli
#   - BUILDDIR_LIBHDKXML : The location of the libhdkxml binaries.
#                          The default is $(HDKDIR)\build\libhdkxml
#   - DEBUG : If defined, the resulting binaries will be built with debug information
#             The default is not defined.
