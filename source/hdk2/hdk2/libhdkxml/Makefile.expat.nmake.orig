# Makefile.expat.nmake - Builds, if required, and locates libexpat libraries
#
# Generated Binary Files
#   + Dynamic library
#      - libexpat.dll : The libexpat dynamic library.
#   + Static library
#      - libexpatMT.lib : The libexpat static library.
#
# Build environment variables
#   - BUILD : If defined the libraries are build to $(BUILDDIR). Otherwise the binaries are copy from $(EXPATDIR)\Bin to $(BUILDDIR)
#             The default is not defined (i.e. copy)
#   - BUILDDIR : The directory in which the generated binary files are placed.
#                The default is $(HDKDIR)\build\libhdkxml
#   - EXPATDIR : The directory in which libexpat is installed.
#                The default is %ProgramFiles%\Expat 2.0.1
#   - DEBUG : If defined, the resulting binaries will be built with debug information.
#             The default is not defined.
#   - LIBEXPAT_BUILD : If defined, libexpat will be built using the Makefile.expat.build.nmake makefile,
#                      otherwise the files installed with the libexpat distro are simply copied to $(BUILDDIR).
#                      This is typically only used for native x64 builds of the libexpat libraries.
