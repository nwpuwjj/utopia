# This script is called when the value of <desired_ipv4_link_state, *> changes.
# desired_ipv4_link_state is one of:
#    up             - The system wants to bring the wan ipv4 link up
#    down           - The system wants to bring the wan ipv4 link down
#
# The script is called with one parameter:
#   The value of the parameter is phylink_wan_state if the physical link state has changed
#   and it is desired_state_change if the desired_ipv4_link_state has changed
#
# This script is responsible for bringing up connectivity with
# the ISP using static provisioning.
#
# It is responsible for provisioning the interface IP Address, and the
# routing table. And also /etc/resolv.conf
#
# Upon success it must set:
#    sysevent ipv4_wan_ipaddr
#    sysevent ipv4_wan_subnet
#    sysevent current_ipv4_link_state
